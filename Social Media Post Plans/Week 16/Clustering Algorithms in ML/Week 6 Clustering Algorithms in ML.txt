**Week 6: Clustering Algorithms in ML**

**Post 1: The Basics of Clustering**
1. **Group Dynamics:** Clustering organizes similar data points into groups, revealing natural divisions within the data.
2. **Automatic Categorization:** Unlike classification, clustering doesn't need predefined categories; it discovers them inherently in the data.
3. **Pattern Discovery:** It's a form of unsupervised learning used to identify patterns and relationships that aren't explicitly labeled.
4. **Versatility in Data:** Clustering is applied to diverse data types, from customer demographics to genetic information.
5. **Iterative Approach:** Clustering algorithms typically refine their groups iteratively, adjusting until the data is optimally divided.

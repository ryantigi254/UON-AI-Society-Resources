**Post 3: Hierarchical and Density-Based Clustering Techniques**
1. **Layered Linkages:** Hierarchical clustering creates a tree of clusters called a dendrogram, showing data's nested groupings.
2. **Close Quarters:** Density-based clustering, like DBSCAN, groups points that are closely packed together, marking outliers in sparse areas.
3. **Visualizing Data Family Trees:** Hierarchical methods offer a visual hierarchy of clusters, useful for understanding complex data relationships.
4. **Handling Noise:** Density-based methods are good at separating 'noise' from core points in the data, robust to outliers.
5. **Flexible Frameworks:** These techniques do not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand, providing flexibility in data exploration.

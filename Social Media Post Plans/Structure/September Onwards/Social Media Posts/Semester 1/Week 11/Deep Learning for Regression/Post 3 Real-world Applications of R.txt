**Post 3: Real-world Applications of Regression in Deep Learning**
1. **Predictive Modeling:** Apply a deep learning regression model to a predictive modeling problem in finance, like stock price forecasting, assessing its predictive capabilities.
2. **Time Series Analysis:** Utilize RNNs or LSTMs for regression in time series analysis, predicting future values in sequences like sales data or weather patterns.
3. **Energy Demand Forecasting:** Implement deep regression models to forecast energy demand, optimizing resource allocation and grid management.
4. **Healthcare Predictions:** Use regression models to predict health-related outcomes, such as patient recovery times or disease progression rates.
5. **Real Estate Valuation:** Develop a regression model to estimate real estate values based on multiple input features, testing its accuracy against market data.

**Post 2: Building Your First ML Model**
1. **Model Selection:** Choose an ML model that is appropriate for the type of problem you are trying to solve (e.g., classification, regression).
2. **Feature Engineering:** Prepare and engineer your data features to enhance model performance and accuracy.
3. **Model Training:** Train your model using your dataset, adjusting parameters as needed to improve its learning.
4. **Validation:** Validate your modelâ€™s performance using a separate dataset to prevent overfitting and ensure that it generalizes well.
5. **Iteration:** ML is an iterative process; continue refining your model based on performance feedback and new data.

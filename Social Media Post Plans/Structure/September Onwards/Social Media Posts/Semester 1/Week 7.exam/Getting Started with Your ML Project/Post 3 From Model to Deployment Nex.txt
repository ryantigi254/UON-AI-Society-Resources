**Post 3: From Model to Deployment: Next Steps**
1. **Performance Tuning:** Optimize your model for better performance, considering factors such as speed, accuracy, and resource consumption.
2. **Deployment Strategies:** Plan for deployment by considering how the model will be integrated into existing systems or products.
3. **User Testing:** Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the modelâ€™s performance in real-world conditions.
4. **Maintenance Plans:** Develop a maintenance plan for the model, including regular updates and retraining with new data.
5. **Scale and Evolve:** As your ML model proves successful, consider scaling and evolving it to handle more data, more complex problems, or broader applications.

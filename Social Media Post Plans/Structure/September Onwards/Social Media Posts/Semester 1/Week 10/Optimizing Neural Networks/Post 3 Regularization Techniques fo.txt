**Post 3: Regularization Techniques for Model Improvement**
1. **Implement Regularization:** Apply L1 and L2 regularization techniques in your model training to observe their effects on performance and overfitting.
2. **Dropout Exploration:** Experiment with dropout in a neural network model to understand its impact on reducing overfitting and improving generalization.
3. **Early Stopping Practice:** Incorporate early stopping in your training process to prevent overfitting, monitoring validation loss to halt training at the optimal point.
4. **Batch Normalization:** Integrate batch normalization into a deep network to stabilize learning and improve convergence speed.
5. **Regularization Strategy:** Develop a regularization strategy for a deep learning project, combining techniques based on the model's complexity and dataset size.

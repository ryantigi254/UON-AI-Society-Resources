**Post 2: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks**
1. **Retaining Relevance:** LSTMs are a type of RNN that are designed to remember important information for long durations and forget the non-essential.
2. **Gatekeepers of Data:** They use structures called 'gates' to control the flow of information, deciding what to keep in memory and what to discard.
3. **Complex Dependencies:** Their architecture enables them to capture complex dependencies and relationships in sequence data, such as the context in a conversation.
4. **Widespread Applications:** LSTMs power many applications, from composing music to predictive texting, due to their sequence modeling prowess.
5. **Solving Sequence Puzzles:** By addressing the vanishing gradient problem, LSTMs maintain a balance between retaining past information and processing new inputs effectively.

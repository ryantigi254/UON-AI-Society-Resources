**Post 3: The Power of Unsupervised Learning in DL**
1. **Self-taught Systems:** Unsupervised learning in deep learning involves models that learn from unlabeled data, finding structure and patterns without explicit instruction.
2. **Cluster Comprehension:** These models can group data points into clusters based on similarity, useful in exploratory data analysis or market segmentation.
3. **Association Analysis:** Unsupervised learning uncovers relationships between variables, which can lead to insights such as customer buying behaviors.
4. **Anomaly Alert:** It's instrumental in anomaly detection, flagging unusual data points that could indicate issues like fraud or system faults.
5. **Feature Formation:** Unsupervised learning helps in feature formation, where the model identifies and creates new features that can improve the performance of supervised learning tasks.

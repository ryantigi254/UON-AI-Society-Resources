**Post 3: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Applications**
1. **Understanding VAEs:** Introduce Variational Autoencoders, highlighting their structure and how they differ from traditional autoencoders.
2. **Implementing a VAE:** Build and train a VAE on a dataset, using it to generate new data instances that resemble the original data.
3. **VAE in Data Generation:** Explore the use of VAEs in generating complex data, such as faces or voices, understanding the limitations and potential of VAEs.
4. **

Latent Space Exploration:** Learn about the concept of latent space in VAEs and how it can be explored and manipulated to control the characteristics of generated data.
5. **VAE Applications Beyond Generation:** Investigate other applications of VAEs, including anomaly detection and feature extraction, expanding your understanding of their versatility.

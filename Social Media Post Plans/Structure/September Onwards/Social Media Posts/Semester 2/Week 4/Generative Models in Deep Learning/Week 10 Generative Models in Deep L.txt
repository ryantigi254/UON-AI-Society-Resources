**Week 10: Generative Models in Deep Learning**

**Post 1: Introduction to Generative Models**
1. **Generative vs. Discriminative Models:** Understand the difference between generative and discriminative models, focusing on their goals and applications.
2. **Exploring GANs:** Delve into Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), learning how the generator and discriminator work together to produce new data instances.
3. **Building a Simple GAN:** Construct a basic GAN using a deep learning framework and train it to generate images similar to those in your dataset.
4. **Generative Model Applications:** Explore applications of generative models, from data augmentation to creating art and synthetic datasets.
5. **Ethical Considerations:** Discuss the ethical implications of generative models, including concerns about deepfakes and data authenticity.

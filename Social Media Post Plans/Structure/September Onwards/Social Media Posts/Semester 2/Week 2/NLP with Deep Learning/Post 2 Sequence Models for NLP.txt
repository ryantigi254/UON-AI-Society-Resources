**Post 2: Sequence Models for NLP**
1. **Understanding Sequence Models:** Delve into how sequence models like RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs are applied in NLP tasks to handle the sequential nature of text.
2. **Sequence to Sequence Models:** Learn about sequence-to-sequence models and their applications in tasks like machine translation and summarization.
3. **Implementing Seq2Seq Models:** Build a simple sequence-to-sequence model using a deep learning framework, applying it to a language task of your choice.
4. **Attention Mechanisms:** Explore the concept of attention mechanisms in sequence models and how they improve model performance by focusing on relevant parts of the input.
5. **NLP Sequence Projects:** Engage in a project that leverages sequence models for NLP, such as developing a simple translation tool or an automatic summarizer.

**Post 3: BERT, GPT, and the Landscape of Transformer Models**
1. **BERT Exploration:** Dive into BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), understanding its architecture and pre-training tasks.
2. **GPT Insights:** Investigate GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) models, learning how they're trained and their capabilities in generating coherent text.
3. **Fine-Tuning Transformer Models:** Practice fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT or GPT model for a specific NLP task, such as sentiment analysis or question-answering.
4. **Transformer Models Comparison:** Compare different Transformer models on the same NLP task, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses.
5. **Staying Updated:** Keep abreast of the latest developments in Transformer models, noting emerging architectures and their potential impacts on NLP and beyond.

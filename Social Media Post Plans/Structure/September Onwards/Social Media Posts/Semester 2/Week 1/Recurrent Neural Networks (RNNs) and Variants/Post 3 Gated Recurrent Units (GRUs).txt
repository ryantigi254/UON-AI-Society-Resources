**Post 3: Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Beyond**
1. **GRU Introduction:** Introduce Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) as a variant of RNNs that simplifies the LSTM model while retaining its ability to capture long-term dependencies.
2. **Building a GRU Model:** Create a GRU-based model for a sequence processing task, noting the differences in implementation and performance compared to LSTMs.
3. **GRU vs. LSTM Comparison:** Compare GRU and LSTM models on the same task to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and use-case suitability.

. **Exploring Advanced RNN Variants:** Explore advanced RNN variants and modifications that address specific challenges or improve performance in certain tasks.
5. **Creative Sequence Applications:** Engage in a creative project that uses GRUs or another advanced RNN variant, such as generating music or automatic speech recognition.

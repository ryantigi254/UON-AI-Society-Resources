**Post 2: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks**
1. **LSTM Overview:** Learn about LSTMs and how they overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs by better handling long-term dependencies.
2. **Implementing an LSTM:** Build an LSTM model for a task like sentiment analysis or language translation, using a popular deep learning framework.
3. **Tuning LSTM Parameters:** Experiment with different LSTM parameters, such as the number of layers and memory units, to optimize your model's performance.
4. **LSTM in Depth:** Dive deeper into the internal mechanisms of LSTMs, including the roles of the forget, input, and output gates.
5. **Advanced LSTM Projects:** Consider a more advanced project using LSTMs, such as a chatbot or a more complex language model that can generate coherent paragraphs.

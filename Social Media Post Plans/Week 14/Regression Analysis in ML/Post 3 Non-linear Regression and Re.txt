**Post 3: Non-linear Regression and Real-world Applications**
1. **Beyond Straight Lines:** Non-linear regression models complex relationships where changes in predictor variables don't correspond evenly with output.
2. **Growth Patterns:** It's used in biology to model growth rates that accelerate or decelerate over time.
3. **Market Saturation:** In business, non-linear regression helps understand when a market will become saturated as product adoption grows.
4. **Engineering Dynamics:** Engineers use it to understand the stress and strain on materials under various forces.
5. **Climate Change Modeling:** Scientists predict climate changes by modeling non-linear relationships in environmental data.
